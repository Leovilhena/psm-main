Task 1
Design, write and test a computer application that finds the roots of any nonlinear equation entered as initial data,
and then solves this nonlinear equation by three methods:
1. bisection method,
2. by the regula falsi method and
3. by secant method,
and then comparing the results obtained.

Task 2
Create computer applications that implement numerical integration
1. by the rectangles method,
2. the trapezoidal method and
3. parabol method.
Use these applications to calculate integrals of functions for which you know exactly the results of integration,
and then compare and discuss the results obtained.

Task 4
Build a computer application that implements your own version of the Game of Life.

Task 5
Suggest and implement your own version of the Flock computer application
so that you can have a greater impact on the behavior of animated objects and the quality of scenes.

Task 10
Make the computer applications drawing:
1. Barnsley fern
2. Mandelbrot fractal
3. your own fractal

Task 11
Suggest and run a computer application simulating the dynamic system drawing the Lissajous curve.

Task 13
Play a computer-modified head and head game when instead of coins, players throw dice alternately (one dice, two dice, etc.),
where e.g. the even sum of the bets on the rolled dice is an eagle, and the odd sum of the bets on the rolled dice is tails.
How does the game change depending on the number of cubes and the number of players in the game?
