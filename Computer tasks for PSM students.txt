Computer applications for PSM lectures 2020/2021

Numeric task 1.
Design, write and test a computer application that finds the roots of any nonlinear equation entered as initial data, and then solves this nonlinear equation by three methods:
1. bisection method,
2. by the regula falsi method and
3. by secant method,
and then comparing the results obtained.

Numeric task 2.
Create computer applications that implement numerical integration 
1. by the rectangles method,
2. the trapezoidal method and
3. parabol method.
Use these applications to calculate integrals of functions for which you know exactly the results of integration, and then compare and discuss the results obtained.

Numeric task 3.
Build a computer application that calculates the area of the surface using the Monte Carlo method for
1. regular geometric figures (squares, rectangles),
2. any triangles and / or other polygons,
3. between the coordinate axis 0x and the graph of any function within the specified range of values.

Numeric task 4.
Build a computer application that implements your own version of the Game of Life.

Numeric task 5.
Suggest and implement your own version of the Flock computer application so that you can have a greater impact on the behavior of animated objects and the quality of scenes.

Numeric task 6.
Make a computer application that draws a diagram of the mathematical pendulum motion in phase space
1. without damping.
2. with damping.
in the gravitational field (its values can be changed) and for various deflections from the equilibrium position.

Numeric task 7.
Propose experiments and implement them in the form of a computer application implementing various variants of vibrations of various mathematical pendulums and drawing a trace of pendulum movements on a horizontal viewport
1. simple,
2. complex, consisting of several "sub-pendula".
Take into account the possibility of changing pendulum parameters.

Numeric task 8.
Suggest an algorithm for changing the directions and values of velocities after the collision of two material points
1. with similar masses, and
2. with very different masses,
and implement it in the form of a computer application visualizing the results obtained.
Include the option of changing task parameters.

Numeric task 9.
Create a computer application calculating the probability that after doing the N  steps the drunkard will be in the position  x = m l, with different probalilites p and q, where
p �  probability that the drunkard goes left; q =1-
p  � probability that the drunkard goes right, l � the length of one step,  m l � the length of the walk to the left from the starting position.

Numeric task 10.
Make the computer applications drawing:
1. Barnsley fern
2. Mandelbrot fractal
3. your own fractal

Numeric task 11.
Suggest and run a computer application simulating the dynamic system drawing the Lissajous curve.

Numeric task 12.
Write a computer application (nicely developed graphically) simulating according to Einstein's theory changes inertial body mass with a change in body speed in the inertial reference system.
And what would this situation look like in a non-inertial frame of reference?

Numeric task 13.
Play a computer-modified head and head game when instead of coins, players throw dice alternately (one dice, two dice, etc.),
where e.g. the even sum of the bets on the rolled dice is an eagle, and the odd sum of the bets on the rolled dice is tails.
How does the game change depending on the number of cubes and the number of players in the game?

Numeric task 14.
